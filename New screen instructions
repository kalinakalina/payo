Goal: Build a brand‑native screen (no placeholders) using Payoneer’s DS + repo assets.

Source of truth (in this order):

Payoneer DS tokens (colors, type, spacing, radii, elevation, interactions)

Payoneer repo assets (SVGs, fonts) — by exact path + commit SHA

If missing: recreate from DS or pull public micro‑assets only for tiny glyphs (caret/badge), matching DS visually.

Process (must follow in order):

Bottom nav first – Use approved SVG from repo. Confirm active tab.

Plan the screen – IA, component list, and content map (bulleted).

Asset hunt – For each component, list exact repo filenames you’ll use. If name is unclear, open each SVG in the folder; do not guess.

Zero‑placeholder check – If any asset/text isn’t final, stop and ask.

DS apply – Wire tokens:

Colors: primary #FF4800, gradient ring #ff4700→#eaa300→#ccd90d→#66db4a→#1cd293→#069fdf→#6574e7→#dd53c5→#ef4c5b

Semantic: success #1CD293, warning #EAA300, error #EF4C5B, info #069FDF

Neutrals: background/surface #FFF, border #E0E0E0, text #252526, secondary #6F6F70, disabled #B6B6B6

Type: Avenir Next World (Demi for headings, Regular for body)

Spacing scale: 4/8/12/16/24/32 (stick to it)

Radii & elevation: soft corners (10–16px), subtle shadows

Interactions – Use your micro‑interaction rules:

transition: all .2s cubic-bezier(.2,0,0,1)

Hover lift translateY(-2px), Active scale(.98), Focus outline

Shadow progression: normal→hover→active as specified

Implement – Build responsive (mobile‑first), no layout shifts, safe‑area padding.

Audit – Checklist below. Fix deltas before shipping.

Deliverable: Single standalone HTML (CodePen‑ready), referencing repo assets by commit SHA. No external libs unless approved.

Stop rules:

If I can’t find an asset by name, stop and ask.

If DS and screenshot conflict, ask which wins.

If mobile QA shows layout drift, pause and fix responsiveness before continuing.

Audit checklist (before you ever see it):

 All colors match DS tokens (no off‑grays).

 All icons are from repo (or approved micro‑assets).

 Typography weights/sizes correct; no fake bold.

 Spacing on the 4/8/12/16 grid; dividers #E0E0E0.

 Interactions behave per spec (hover/active/focus).

 Responsive: 320–430px widths, safe area respected.

 No placeholders, no guessed assets, no broken links.
